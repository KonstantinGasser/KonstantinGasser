# Hello There ðŸ––

## At the moment...
I am currently writing my bachelor thesis about scalable and performan data models for click-stream data in big data systems. Super exited to deepen my understanding by working and researching SQL and NoSQL databases!

## ðŸ”­ Side Projects I am working on...

- [sherlock](github.com/KonstantinGasser/sherlock) a simple cli password manager which suits my needs
- [humanci](github.com/KonstantinGasser/humanci) (about to become) a different approach fÃ¼r CLIs which lets you define commands which complete and correct sentences instead of having flags and args :D

Besides my thesis, I love to hack in #golang and generally am interested in distributed systems and environments.
<!--
## What I am up to right now 
Currently writing my bachelor theses about clickstream platforms and am therefore building one.
Part of the theses will talk about how to scale application in the cloud. Another part is about how to utilize big-data frameworks like Flink to make real time analyse. [this-is-the-state-of-it](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/clickstream)
