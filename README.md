# Hello There ðŸ––

## About me

I am 22 year software engineer who got hooked on programming ðŸ¥´. In my free time I try to do cool things however many of them are just things :D. 

Already during my studies I got very excited about distributed systems and their way of working. This is one of the reasons I am hacking in #golang for the last two years now! So much fun ðŸ˜‡.

## ðŸ”­ Side Projects I am working on...

### ***weeat***

[weeat](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/weeat) is yet to become something cool - however, the idea behind the app is that I really got annoyed by the fact that apps for recipes, calorie tracking and meal plans hit you with a paywall...not cool. The basic idea of `weeat` is to let the network, the users be the content creator - and be free for all while collecting no user data at any point in time. Cause not all things needs to make profit, right!

ðŸ‘‰ go check it out ***[weeat](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/weeat)*** , feedback and contributions are very much appreciated :) 


### ***sherlock***
`sherlock` is a very simple cli password manager which suits my needs. I use it every day to manage my passwords for online accounts and servers.
