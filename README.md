# Hello There ðŸ––

## ðŸ«  Currently confused about...
### Programming
This is a small collection of projects to practivce and playaround with rust and its eco-system

### Concepts
ðŸ‘‰ ***[rusting](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/ziggy/tree/main/rust)***

Besides programming I am facinated with replication and consensus protocols. Currently trying to wrap my head around [Viewstamped Replication Revisited](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf)..


## ðŸ”­ Side Projects I am working on...

### beam me up, [scotty](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/scotty)
Why only query and multiplex logs in production environments? `scotty` helps with that by multiplexing your logs from many local applications into a consolidated view on which you can apply filters or even run queries on your logs!

ðŸ‘‰ ***[scotty](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/scotty)*** contributions and/or feedback appreciated :)

### ***sherlock***
`sherlock` is a very simple cli password manager which suits my needs. I use it every day to manage my passwords for online accounts and servers.
