# Hello There ðŸ––

<!-- ## About me

I am 23 year software engineer who got hooked on programming ðŸ¥´. In my free time I try to do cool things however many of them are just things 

Already during my studies I got very excited about distributed systems and their way of working. This is one of the reasons I am hacking in #golang for the last two years now! So much fun ðŸ˜‡ -->
