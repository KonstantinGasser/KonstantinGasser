# Hello There 🖖

## 🔭 Side Projects I am working on...

- [sherlock](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/sherlock) a simple CLI password manager which suits my needs
- [davinci](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/davinci) web-app to control a 16x16 LED matrix, playting snake and displaying gifs

I love to hack in #golang and generally am interested in distributed systems and environments ☁️🌏.

## What I am up to right now 
Currently writing my bachelor theses about clickstream platforms and am therefore building one.
Part of the theses will talk about how to scale application in the cloud. Another part is about how to utilize big-data frameworks like Flink to make real time analyse. [this-is-the-state-of-it](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/clickstream)
