## What I am up to right now 
Currently writing my bachelor theses about clickstream platforms and am therefore building one.
Part of the theses will talk about how to scale application in the cloud. Another part is about how to utilize big-data frameworks like Flink to make real time analyse. [this-is-the-state-of-it](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/clickstream)
