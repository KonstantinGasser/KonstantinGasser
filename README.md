# Hello There ðŸ––

<!-- ## About me

I am 23 year software engineer who got hooked on programming ðŸ¥´. In my free time I try to do cool things however many of them are just things 

Already during my studies I got very excited about distributed systems and their way of working. This is one of the reasons I am hacking in #golang for the last two years now! So much fun ðŸ˜‡ -->

## ðŸ”­ Side Projects I am working on...

<!-- ### ***weeat***

[weeat](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/weeat) is an open network for sharing information about food nutrition values, recipes and allows you to generate meal-plans for you. Got annoyed that all the exiting apps hit you with a pay-walls..

ðŸ‘‰ go check it out ***[weeat](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/weeat)*** , feedback and contributions are very much appreciated :)  -->

### beam me up, [scotty](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/scotty)
Why only query and multiplex logs in production environments? `scotty` helps with that by multiplexing your logs from many local applications into a consolidated view on which you can apply filters or even run queries on your logs!

ðŸ‘‰ ***[scotty](https://github.com/KonstantinGasser/scotty)*** contributions and/or feedback apricated :)

### ***sherlock***
`sherlock` is a very simple cli password manager which suits my needs. I use it every day to manage my passwords for online accounts and servers.
